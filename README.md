# GorillaEntertainmentSystem
A port of [UNES](https://github.com/ls9512/UNES), a Unity NES emulator, to Gorilla Tag.  
This mod plays (most) .nes ROM files directly inside Gorilla Tag.

# Setup
Download the .zip from the releases tab and extract it into your plugins folder. It may have 2 folders, e.g. BepInEx/plugins/GorillaEntertainmentSystem/GorillaEntertainmentSystem/GorillaEntertainmentSystem.dll. If it does, make it so your file structure looks like this:
```
BepInEx
  plugins
    GorillaEntertainmentSystem
      roms
        (.nes roms go here)
      saves
        (.sav files generated by the mod go here)
      GorillaEntertainmentSystem.dll
```
Put your .nes ROMs in the roms folder. This mod does not come with any ROMs.  
If you don't have any ROMs, you can get an NES cartridge of the game you want along with a [cartridge reader](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader) and rip them that way. I can't legally tell you how to get them otherwise.

Your game will automatically save (if it supports saving) when you change games, power off, or quit Gorilla Tag.

# Controls

- VR Left Joystick = NES D-Pad

# Settings/Config
## Swap hands
- Swaps the inputs between controllers, mainly intended for those who have stick drift in their left joystick.
## Grab to use
- Whether you need to be holding the tablet for your inputs to register. Intended to prevent accidental inputs when not playing.

# Changes
- Added support for SRAM saving/loading for games that use it.
- Added a power button to power off the emulator when not in use.

# Known Issues (Let me know if you encounter any other issues!)
- Certain games not booting due to an unsupported mapper. Probably won't be fixed any time soon.
- Pausing in some games turns the screen white.
